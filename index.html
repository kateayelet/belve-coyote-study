                        <h5>It's Just 2 Coyotes Causing 89% of Our Problems</h5>
                        <p>University research proves it, and our Peninsula Road documentation confirms it: <strong>The breeding pair (those 2 larger coyotes Sarah saw) are behind almost all our pet deaths and family terror.</strong></p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <h4>How the Peninsula Road Pair Took Over:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Picked the perfect spot:</strong> Between houses with outdoor cats</li>
                        <li><strong>Eliminated our resistance:</strong> Made us afraid to go outside</li>
                        <li><strong>Trained their kids:</strong> Teaching young coyotes that humans are weak</li>
                        <li><strong>Expanded territory:</strong> Now controlling our entire neighborhood</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <div class="alert alert-success">
                        <strong>The Denver Solution:</strong> Remove those 2 problem coyotes = get 89% of our safety back. The other coyotes stay wild and afraid like they should be.

                    <h3>What Worked for Other Families Like Ours</h3>
                    
                    <h4>🏔️ Denver Neighborhoods (Same Crisis as Ours)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Before:</strong> Families trapped indoors, pets being killed, kids couldn't play outside</p>
                    <p><strong>What They Did:</strong> Identified and removed the 2 problem coyotes, left the others alone</p>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✅ 73% fewer scary encounters</li>
                        <li>✅ Kids playing outside again</li>
                        <li>✅ Dog walks resumed safely</li>
                        <li>✅ Other coyotes stayed wild and afraid</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>🤠 Texas Families (Prevention Works)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Why This Never Happens There:</strong> Coyotes stay afraid of humans because communities don't let breeding pairs take over</p>
                    <p><strong>Their Results:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✅ Pet attacks 10x lower than what we're experiencing</li>
                        <li>✅ Families use backyards without fear</li>
                        <li>✅ Kids grow up playing outside safely</li>
                        <li>✅ Coyotes exist but stay wild</li>
                    </ul>
