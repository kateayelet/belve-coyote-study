## Incident Heat Map

### Geographic Distribution of 574+ Incidents

**High-Density Zones:**
- **Zone 1**: Peninsula Road Corridor (131 incidents, 0.1 sq mi)
- **Zone 2**: Park Perimeter (89 incidents, 0.15 sq mi)  
- **Zone 3**: Residential Core (234 incidents, 0.25 sq mi)

**Breeding Pair Territory Analysis:**
- **67% of all incidents** occur within 0.2 miles of identified breeding pair den
- **89% of confirmed predation** traceable to breeding pair hunting patterns
- **Territory expansion rate**: 0.05 miles per month during establishment phase

## Temporal Analysis Dashboard

### Peak Activity Patterns

**Daily Activity Distribution:**
- **3:00-6:00 AM**: 41% of incidents (Peak hunting period)
- **8:00-10:00 PM**: 28% of incidents (Secondary activity)
- **10:00 PM-3:00 AM**: 19% of incidents (Territory patrol)
- **6:00 AM-8:00 PM**: 12% of incidents (Daylight escalation)

**Seasonal Escalation Pattern:**
- **January-May 2024**: 34 incidents (Baseline)
- **June-August 2024**: 187 incidents (Territory establishment)
- **September-December 2024**: 353+ incidents (Full territorial control)

**Escalation Rate**: 340% increase over 6-month period

## Policy Failure Metrics

### California Protection Model Results

**Intervention Attempts:**
- **Hazing Protocols**: Applied 23 times
- **Initial Success Rate**: 78% (temporary retreat)
- **Adaptation Period**: 2-3 weeks average
- **Final Effectiveness**: 0% (complete habituation)

**Community Impact Progression:**
- **Month 1**: Single household affected
- **Month 3**: Three households modify behavior  
- **Month 6**: Entire street corridor impacted
- **Month 12**: Community-wide outdoor activity cessation

**Property Rights Violations:**
- **Residents unable to use yards**: 12+ households
- **Pet confinement required**: 100% of pet owners
- **Children's outdoor play restricted**: 8+ families

## Breeding Pair Analysis

### The 89% Rule: Breeding Pair Predation Dominance

**Research Basis:**
- University study: 89% of sheep predation attributed to breeding pairs
- Belvedere confirmation: 89% of pet deaths traceable to single breeding pair

**Territorial Behavior Patterns:**
1. **Den Site Selection**: 0.3 miles from multiple prey sources
2. **Hunting Route Establishment**: Linear corridor between prey concentrations
3. **Territory Marking**: Systematic scent marking every 50-100 yards
4. **Human Intimidation**: Progressive boldness to secure territory

**Pack Structure Analysis:**
- **Alpha Pair**: Territory establishment and hunting strategy
- **Beta Adults**: Support hunting but follow alpha decisions  
- **Juvenile Members**: Learning behavior, minimal independent predation
- **Lone Individuals**: Opportunistic, non-territorial hunting

**Key Insight**: Remove breeding pair = disrupt 89% of predation activity

## Economic Impact Analysis

### Cost of Protection Policies

**Direct Costs to Residents:**
- **Pet Replacement**: $15,000+ (13 confirmed deaths × avg $1,200)
- **Veterinary Bills**: $8,000+ (31 attacks × avg $250)
- **Property Modifications**: $25,000+ (fencing, lighting, cameras)
- **Insurance Claims**: Data pending

**Indirect Economic Impact:**
- **Property Value Effect**: Estimated 5-8% reduction in affected areas
- **Lost Recreation Value**: Residents unable to use outdoor space
- **Childcare Modifications**: Indoor alternatives, supervised outdoor time

**Policy Administration Costs:**
- **Animal Control Response**: 147+ calls, estimated $11,000
- **Failed Hazing Programs**: $3,000+ training and implementation
- **Legal Consultation**: Residents seeking rights assessment

**Total Community Cost**: $62,000+ for 18-month period
**Per Capita Impact**: $29+ per resident for failed policy

## Success Metrics: Alternative Models

### Colorado Targeted Management Results

**Before Targeted Intervention:**
- **Annual Conflicts**: 200+ incidents
- **Pet Deaths**: 15+ annually
- **Human Approaches**: 8+ annually

**After Breeding Pair Removal:**
- **Annual Conflicts**: 54 incidents (73% reduction)
- **Pet Deaths**: 2-3 annually (80% reduction)  
- **Human Approaches**: 1-2 annually (85% reduction)

**Population Impact:**
- **Total Population**: Stable (no significant change)
- **Reproductive Success**: Maintained in non-conflict areas
- **Territorial Behavior**: Returned to natural wariness patterns

### Texas/Utah Cultural Pressure Model

**High-Pressure Harvest Results:**
- **Human Safety**: Maintained despite high coyote populations
- **Natural Wariness**: Preserved through cultural hunting pressure
- **Conflict Rate**: 10-15x lower than California protection zones

**Key Factor**: Cultural acceptance of lethal control maintains natural fear responses

## Interactive Policy Comparison

### Three Models Side-by-Side

| Metric | California Protection | Texas/Utah Harvest | Colorado Targeted |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Human Safety** | ❌ Failed | ✅ Effective | ✅ Excellent |
| **Pet Protection** | ❌ 13+ deaths | ✅ Minimal loss | ✅ 80% reduction |
| **Population Stability** | ⚠️ Unknown | ✅ Stable/High | ✅ Stable |
| **Constitutional Rights** | ❌ Violated | ✅ Protected | ✅ Protected |
| **Community Cost** | ❌ $62,000+ | ✅ Minimal | ✅ Minimal |
| **Ecological Balance** | ❌ Disrupted | ⚠️ Modified | ✅ Restored |
